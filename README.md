# Secure Turtlebot3 Demo

This repository includes a demo for securing a simulated Turtlebot3 using SROS2; including sensor and control topics as well the relevant portions of the cartographer and navigation2 software stacks.

## Setting the Demo

To run this demo using docker, the following dependencies are required:

* [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
  * Login in using x11 for simple display forwarding with containers.
  * Other linux distributions may work, but we'll focus on ubuntu.
* [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  * Prior to workshop, please pull this large image ahead of time:
  * `docker pull rosswg/turtlebot3_demo:roscon19`
* [rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker)
  * Please ensure display forwarding is working with rocker.
  * [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) is also useful for those with a GPU.

  For those who can't use linux containers or for detailed instructions on how to build, you may still follow the general build steps of the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

## Running the demo:

Start by attaching to a byobu session in a new container using rocker. [Byobu](http://www.byobu.org/) is simple wrapper for tmux, where the `F2` key creates and new window, and  `F3`/`F4` move focus among windows, and `Shift-<arrow-keys>` to move focus among window splits. To later exit the entire session, `F6` will exit from byobu and subsequently stop the container and all child processes. Use `Shift-F1` to displays all keybindings. Omit the `--nvidia` arg if you don't have dedicated GPU for hardware acceleration of 3D OpenGL views:

``` bash
rocker --x11 --nvidia rosswg/turtlebot3_demo:roscon19 "byobu -f configs/unsecure.conf attach"
```

Byobu starts a new session and launch the turtlebot3 demo over several windows:

* `turtlebot`
  * turtlebot3 gazebo simulation
  * keyboard control teleportation
  * echo command velocity
* `navigation`
  * navigation2 planning stack
  * initialize pose script
  * navigation goal script
* `mapping`
  * cartographer mapping stack
  * save map file
  * map topic info
* `sros`
  * tree view of keystore
  * generate artifacts command
  * list ROS environment variables
* `diagnostic`
  * glance overview of containerized processes

You can first localize the robot by initializing the pose and then setting a navigation goal via the scripts in the respective window panes. This can also be done graphically via rviz. Feel free to poke around, open a new window and list or echo topics and services. For example, you can stop the navigation2 launch file running map server and and start cartographer from the mapping window to create and then save your own map, then stop cartographer and restart navigation2.

## Running the reconnaissance demo:

Reconnaissance is the act of gathering preliminary data or intelligence on your target. The data is gathered in order to better plan for your attack. Reconnaissance can be performed actively (meaning that you are directly touching/connecting-to the target) or passively (meaning that your reconnaissance is being performed through an intermediary).

The purpose of reconnaissance is to accumulate as much information as possible about a robot or robot component, including the available ROS abstractions (topics, services, etc.), the version of ROS, the targetâ€™s hardware platform and more.

In this short tutorial we'll demonstrate the use of [`aztarna`](https://github.com/aliasrobotics/aztarna/), a tool for performing reconnaissance in a variety of robotic systems. Particularly, we'll look at the information we can obtain by performing active reconnaissance in an unsecure robot acting both as an attacker with direct access to the robot ("host/container" insider) and as an attacker with access to the local internal network where ROS 2 operates.

### Host/container insider attacker
``` bash
rocker rosswg/turtlebot3_demo:roscon19 "byobu -f configs/unsecure.conf attach"
```

### Internal network attacker
``` bash
# in Terminal (terminal 1), initialize first a swarm
docker swarm init
# in Terminal (terminal 1), create the network overlay
docker network create -d overlay \
  --subnet=10.0.0.0/24 \
  --gateway=10.0.0.1 \
	--ip-range 10.0.0.192/27 \
  --attachable \
  overlay

# in another Terminal (terminal 2), launch demo
rocker --network overlay rosswg/turtlebot3_demo:roscon19 "byobu -f configs/unsecure.conf attach"

# in another Terminal (terminal 3), launch another container
docker run -it --rm --network overlay --name aztarna rosswg/turtlebot3_demo:roscon19 /bin/bash
# then perform a scan
$ aztarna -t ros2
```

Cleanup afterwards:
```bash
docker network rm overlay
```


## Running the secure demo:

So far we've simply launched the turtlebot3 without using SROS2. To enable security, simply exit the previous byobu session and start a new one now using the secure config:

``` bash
rocker --x11 --nvidia rosswg/turtlebot3_demo:roscon19 "byobu -f configs/secure.conf attach"
```

This config is the exact same as the previous one, apart from a few SROS2 related environment variables that are exported:

``` bash
export ROS_SECURITY_ENABLE=true
export ROS_SECURITY_STRATEGY=Enforce
export ROS_SECURITY_ROOT_DIRECTORY=$TB3_DEMO_DIR/keystore
export ROS_SECURITY_LOOKUP_TYPE=MATCH_PREFIX
```

These variables simply enable as well as enforce security for all ros2 nodes while specifying the lookup path/strategy for loading key and access control artifacts. For more details on what secure options exist and what each is for, please view the design doc here:

* https://design.ros2.org/articles/ros2_dds_security.html


## Re-generate security artifacts

Using the same attached session above, now lets try and generate security artifacts for ourselves, rather than simply using the same artifacts that came bundled in the demo docker image. We can start by switching over to the sros window and clearing out the existing keystore:

``` bash
cd $TB3_DEMO_DIR
rm -r keystore/*/
```

This will delete all security artifacts for every node, including their certificates and signed permission/governance files. However this will leave the same Certificate Authority (CA) files intact, so that we can play with secure networking later; otherwise new CAs will be generated, limiting later demonstrations.

Next we can halt all of the launch files and ros nodes running in the container, simply by switching the focus to the relevant pane and `Ctrl+C`ing the shell. You can switch to the diagnostic window to glance at all the processes in the container to check if you've missed any.

For now, lets only generate a profile for securing the communication between the teleop node and the simulation. Later we can test than unauthorized teleop nodes fail to connect once SROS is reestablished. Start by disabling security for the panes that were running the simulation and teleop nodes, and then starting them back up:


``` bash
export ROS_SECURITY_ENABLE=false
# <ros2 run or launch command>
```

Now switch over to the sros window and use the `generate_policy` argument with the security verb to generate a new profile. This will inspect current rosgraph to train a starter profile so that we don't have to write it by hand.

``` bash
ros2 security generate_policy policy/my_policy.xml
```

Before using the profile, its wise to audit it first to make sure it contains what we expect. We'll use [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) to view and edit the file. Simply use `Ctrl+S` to save and `Ctrl+Q` to quit the file, or press `Crtl+E` and type `help` for more info. Clicking/scrolling the mouse moves your cursor as expected.

``` bash
micro policy/my_policy.xml
```

We'll use this moment to tweak the policy and add a few pervasive dev permission so that ros2cli functions the same, however you should avoid resorting to wildcards when possible or when outside development. Simply copy and append this into `<profiles>` element:

``` xml
    <profile node="_ros2cli" ns="/">
      <services reply="ALLOW" request="ALLOW">
        <service>*</service>
      </services>
      <topics publish="ALLOW" subscribe="ALLOW">
        <topic>*</topic>
      </topics>
      <actions call="ALLOW" execute="ALLOW">
        <action>*</action>
      </actions>
    </profile>
```

Next we can repopulated the keystore for all profiles via:

``` bash
ros2 security generate_artifacts \
  -p policy/my_policy.xml \
  -k keystore
```

Finally, go back and re-enable security and restart simulation and the teleop nodes.

``` bash
export ROS_SECURITY_ENABLE=true
# <ros2 run or launch command>
```

Now try starting another teleop node with security disabled and check that only the secure teleop node can drive the robot.

## Sandboxed Nodes Demo

The [ROSCon 2019](https://ros-swg.github.io/ROSCon19_Security_Workshop/) [ROS2 Security Workshop](https://ros-swg.github.io/ROSCon19_Security_Workshop/)
will present the opportunity to run the Turtlebot3 demo using the [launch-ros-sandbox](https://github.com/aws-robotics/launch-ros-sandbox)
package. Specifically, the demo uses this package to launch the Turtlebot3 navigation nodes in a docker container. See the
configs/sandbox_demo/navigation_sandbox.launch.py launch file for details.

### Running the Security Workshop Sandbox Node Demo

``` bash
rocker --x11 --nvidia rosswg/turtlebot3_demo "byobu -f configs/sandbox_demo/unsecure.conf attach"
```

Omit the `--nvidia` arg if you don't have dedicated GPU for hardware acceleration of 3D OpenGL views.

Likewise, the following command is used to run the demo using the secure config:

``` bash
rocker --x11 --nvidia  rosswg/turtlebot3_demo "byobu -f configs/sandbox_demo/secure.conf attach"
```

### Demonstrating Sandbox Resource Limits

This demo shows how robot code, acting improperly, can negatively affect the entire robotic system.

``` bash
rocker --x11 --nvidia rosswg/turtlebot3_demo "byobu -f configs/sandbox_demo/bad_actor.conf attach"
```

After launching with the above config, there are two commands ready in the `bad_actor` byobu window.
They are ready to run a cpu hog that will fork many busy processes.
This is a contrived example - but it illustrates what could happen if a node that you are using hits an untested code path and goes into an infinite loop.

If you run the top command (`ros2 run...`), you can see the CPU of your system jump to 100% usage (check the `diagnostic` byobu window), grinding everything else to a halt.

However, if you kill that and run the bottom command (`ros2 launch ...`), it will launch inside a container that has a CPU resource limit set.
This launch will be able to use at most 2 CPUs worth of processing, allowing the rest of the demo to still run at a normal speed.
See `example_nodes/launch/sandboxed_cpu_hog.launch.py` for some more info on the arguments that make this happen.


## Developing
To rebuild this demo locally if you are working on it, you can rebuild the Docker image with the same tag, so all above demo commands will work correctly.

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:ros-swg/turtlebot3_demo.git
cd turtlebot3_demo
docker build . -t rosswg/turtlebot3_demo
```
